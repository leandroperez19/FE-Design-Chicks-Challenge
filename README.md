# Front-end Design Chicks Challenge by Leandro Perez

## Description
This is a design challenge so It's not really complex in terms of logic, I did my best to replicate the design handed to me also adding responsive design and animations when hover, active, etc and I think It turned out great.

The web It's build on react and pure css, you will have the components in both /stylesheets/ and /components/ folder split up in two folders, /layout/ for main components and /ui/ for smaller components.
