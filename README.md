# Front-end Design Chicks Challenge by Leandro Perez

## Description
This is a design challenge so It's not really complex in terms of logic, I did my best to replicate the design handed to me also adding responsive design and animations when hover, active, etc and I think It turned out great.

The web It's build on react and pure css, you will have the components and their respective styles split up in two folders, /layout/ for main components and /ui/ for smaller components.

The useScreen hook works by passing a resolution (in number) so you can render things just in the resolution of your wish.

The card component requires a title, a description, an image and an onSale (true || false), in order to work.
